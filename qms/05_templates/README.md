# Templates

This directory contains document templates for creating records and evidence within the Quality Management System.

## Purpose

Templates provide standardized formats and structures for generating QMS records. They ensure consistency, completeness, and regulatory alignment across documentation while maintaining flexibility for organizational customization.

## Structure

Templates are typically organized by process area or functional domain. Common template categories include:

- **Audits** — Audit plans, programs, and reports
- **Change Control** — Change requests and approvals
- **Clinical** — Clinical evaluation plans and reports
- **Design & Development** — Design reviews, development plans, release validation
- **Quality Events** — Nonconformities, CAPA records
- **Regulatory** — Declarations of conformity, notifications
- **Risk Management** — Risk management plans, reports, risk records
- **Post-Market Surveillance** — PMS reports, PSURs
- **Usability** — Usability evaluation plans and reports
- **Human Resources** — Job descriptions, training records
- **IT & Maintenance** — Maintenance records

## Creating Templates

When creating new templates:

1. **Identify the need** — Determine which records require standardized formats
2. **Reference procedures** — Ensure templates align with relevant procedures
3. **Define structure** — Create clear sections and fields
4. **Include metadata** — Templates should reference document control requirements
5. **Consider regulations** — Ensure templates support regulatory compliance (ISO 13485, MDR)
6. **Version control** — Templates are controlled documents and follow Document Control Procedure

## Template Organization

Templates can be organized in subdirectories by:
- Process area (e.g., `design-development/`, `quality-events/`)
- Document type (e.g., `plans/`, `reports/`, `records/`)
- Functional domain (e.g., `regulatory/`, `hr/`, `it/`)

Choose an organization structure that fits your QMS needs and makes templates easy to locate.

## Relationship to Other QMS Documents

- **Procedures** (level 3) define when and why templates are used
- **Work Instructions** (level 4) may reference specific templates
- **Templates** (level 5) provide the structure for records
- **Records** (level 6) are generated using templates and stored in `qms/06_records/`

## Status

This directory structure is provided as part of the eQMS starter template. Templates should be created based on organizational needs, regulatory requirements, and process requirements.

Organizations implementing this framework should develop templates that align with their specific procedures, workflows, and regulatory context.
