# Records

This directory contains records and evidence generated within the Quality Management System.

## Purpose

Records provide objective evidence of activities performed and results achieved in the QMS. They demonstrate compliance with procedures, standards, and regulatory requirements. Records serve as proof of conformity and support audit, inspection, and regulatory activities.

Records differ from documents:
- **Documents** specify what should be done (procedures, policies, templates)
- **Records** demonstrate what has been done (completed forms, test results, approvals, evidence)

## Structure

Records are typically organized by:
- Process area (e.g., `design-development/`, `quality-events/`, `audits/`)
- Record type (e.g., `test-results/`, `approvals/`, `training/`)
- Chronological organization (e.g., by date or project phase)
- Regulatory requirement (e.g., `mdr/`, `clinical/`, `risk-management/`)

Each organization should establish a structure that:
- Supports easy retrieval and review
- Enables effective record retention management
- Facilitates audit and inspection activities
- Complies with regulatory retention requirements

## Record Characteristics

Records should:
- Be generated using approved templates (from `qms/05_templates/`)
- Include all required information as specified in relevant procedures
- Be dated, signed, and approved as required
- Be retained according to retention policies (ISO 13485, MDR requirements)
- Be protected from loss, damage, or unauthorized alteration
- Be accessible for review, audit, and regulatory inspection

## Relationship to Other QMS Documents

- **Procedures** (level 3) define when and which records must be created
- **Work Instructions** (level 4) may specify how records are generated
- **Templates** (level 5) provide the structure and format for records
- **Records** (level 6) are completed instances generated from templates and stored here

## Record Lifecycle

1. **Creation** — Records are generated during QMS activities (design reviews, audits, training, etc.)
2. **Completion** — Records are filled out using templates and signed/approved as required
3. **Storage** — Records are stored in this directory (or linked systems) with appropriate organization
4. **Retention** — Records are retained per retention policies (typically defined in Document and Record Control Procedure)
5. **Disposition** — Records are archived or disposed of according to retention schedules

## Record Management

- Records are controlled according to the Document and Record Control Procedure
- Record retention periods are defined based on regulatory requirements (ISO 13485, MDR)
- Records may be stored in this repository or in external systems (with proper references)
- Records must be protected from unauthorized access, alteration, or deletion
- Records should be indexed and traceable to related QMS activities

## Status

This directory structure is provided as part of the eQMS starter template. Records will be generated as the QMS becomes operational.

Organizations should:
- Establish record organization and naming conventions
- Define record retention policies aligned with regulatory requirements
- Implement record protection and access controls
- Ensure records are traceable to procedures and processes
