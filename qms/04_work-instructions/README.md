# Work Instructions

This directory contains Work Instructions (WI) for operational tasks within the Quality Management System.

## Purpose

Work Instructions provide detailed, step-by-step guidance for executing specific operational tasks. They complement Procedures by offering granular, practical instructions for personnel performing day-to-day activities.

## Structure

Work Instructions are typically organized by process area or functional domain. Each Work Instruction should:

- Provide clear, actionable steps for task execution
- Include necessary prerequisites and requirements
- Reference applicable procedures
- Define acceptance criteria or expected outcomes
- Be version-controlled and approved according to Document Control requirements

## Relationship to Other QMS Documents

- **Procedures** (level 3) define *what* needs to be done and *why*
- **Work Instructions** (level 4) define *how* to perform specific tasks
- **Templates** (level 5) provide structured formats for records
- **Records** (level 6) capture evidence of task completion

## Creating Work Instructions

1. Identify the specific operational task that needs detailed guidance
2. Reference the related Procedure(s)
3. Document step-by-step instructions
4. Include visual aids (screenshots, diagrams) when helpful
5. Define roles and responsibilities
6. Specify quality criteria or acceptance criteria
7. Follow Document Control Procedure for approval and release

## Status
