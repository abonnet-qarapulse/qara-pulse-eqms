# SMQ Index

## Purpose

This document provides an index of all documents in the Quality Management System (QMS). It serves as a central reference for locating and accessing QMS documents, including governance documents, process descriptions, and procedures that form the foundation of our quality management framework.

The index supports:
- document navigation and discovery,
- QMS structure understanding,
- document control and traceability,
- audit and inspection activities.

---

## Scope

This index includes:
- Governance documents (Quality Manual, Quality Policy, etc.)
- Process descriptions
- Procedures
- Work Instructions (when created by the organization)
- Templates (when created by the organization)
- Index documents (Process Map, Software Inventory, etc.)

The index reflects the current state of the QMS document structure. This document should be updated whenever QMS documents are added, removed, or modified to maintain accuracy and completeness.

## Maintenance

This index can be maintained manually or generated automatically through scripts that scan the QMS directory structure. Organizations may implement automated generation to ensure the index stays synchronized with the actual QMS document structure.

Changes to this index are managed through the **Change Control Procedure** and should be reviewed as part of the **Document and Record Control Procedure**.
