# Archive

This directory contains obsolete or superseded QMS documents that are no longer active but are retained for historical reference, audit purposes, or regulatory requirements.

## Purpose

The archive serves to:

- Preserve historical QMS documentation for audit trails
- Maintain evidence of document evolution and change history
- Support regulatory compliance (retention requirements)
- Enable reference to previous versions when needed

## Structure

Archived documents are typically organized by:

- Document type (e.g., `procedures/`, `governance/`, `processes/`)
- Archive date (e.g., `2024/`, `2023/`)
- Document identifier (e.g., `PROC-001/`, `GOV-001/`)

Each organization should establish an archive structure that:

- Supports easy retrieval when needed
- Enables effective record retention management
- Facilitates audit and inspection activities
- Complies with regulatory retention requirements

## Document Archival

Documents should be archived when:

- They are superseded by new versions
- They are obsolete and no longer applicable
- They are withdrawn from use
- They are replaced by alternative approaches

Archived documents should retain:

- Original document metadata (doc_id, version, effective_date)
- Archive date and reason for archiving
- Reference to the superseding document (if applicable)

## Relationship to Other QMS Documents

- **Active documents** in other QMS directories are current and effective
- **Archived documents** in this directory are historical and no longer active
- The **Document and Record Control Procedure** defines the archival process
- The **SMQ-INDEX.md** may reference archived documents for traceability

## Status

This directory structure is provided as part of the eQMS starter template. Organizations should establish archiving procedures as part of their Document and Record Control process.

Organizations implementing this framework should develop archiving procedures that align with their retention policies and regulatory requirements.
