# Technical Documentation (MDR Annex II & III)

This folder provides a Technical Documentation (TD) starter structure aligned with:
- EU MDR 2017/745 — Annex II (Technical Documentation)
- EU MDR 2017/745 — Annex III (Post-Market Surveillance)

This structure is intended to complement the Git-based eQMS under `qms/`:
- The QMS defines processes, roles, and controlled rules.
- The Technical Documentation contains product-specific evidence and demonstration of compliance.

Git-native control principles apply:
- Changes are proposed through Pull Requests.
- Reviews serve as approvals/signatures.
- Merge to `main` makes the change effective and auditable.

All content here is template-based and must be instantiated per product and organization.
